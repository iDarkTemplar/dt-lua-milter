dt-lua-milter is a mail filter based on libmilter which allows to run custom lua scripts to filter the email

Currently dt-lua-milter registers itself as read-only filter, i.e. doesn't modify the message.

Current default script "scripts/default.lua" checks that sender header address and sender envelope address comply following rules:
	1) if sender header address is present in aliases file, then sender envelope address must match one of aliases from this file
	2) if sender header address isn't present in aliases file, then sender envelope address must match sender header address

Alias file is in postfix-compatible format: each line contains a list of addresses separated by delimiter: one of space characters or comma,
	first address being main email address and all other addresses being it's aliases.
	For more info see Postfix manual for smtpd_sender_login_maps.
